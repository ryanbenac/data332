# Butterfly Data: Change in Wing Proportions Over Time
## Introduction
The butterly data set contains information concerning observtions on the Pieris rapae butterly. Measurements of various propotions are included as well as the year those observations were made for each specific sample. This analysis examines change in wing proportions (length, width, and apex size) over time. This report will also supply information concerning statistics about the data as a whole, as well as steps taken to clean the data. The proportions analyzed in this report are limited to wing length, wing width, and black patch apex.

For reference, below is a labeled chart of a butterfly.

## Data Cleaning
In order for the data to be analyzed and produce meaningful data, it must be cleaned to ensure consistency. The following data cleaning steps were taken on this data set: 
1. Modify SexUpdated column so that it only contained male, female, or unknown/blanks
2. N/A values of any numerical proportion column changed to 0
3. Ensured all values in YearUpdated were in a consistent year format

## Statistics About Data

The above statistics show the min, average, and max for the three analyzed columns. This is important because it shows (roughly) the distribution of proportions. See below for a visual representation.
